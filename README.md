# Music-Interaction-Project

This is a program I made using Python and Tkinter. It is a program that users (specifically those who don't know a lot about music) can use to create their own music. 
I was thinking it could have uses in music therapy or other spaces where music can be used for healing. It allows people to be creative and make new music without
needing to learn about music theory or sheet music. To start, run the program 'Main'. You may have to download certain packages for it to work. 

Click a box with an instrument name to hear a phrase. Click new phrase for a different phrase. Use the louder and softer buttons to adjust each instrument. 
Use the play button to play the whole song (all of the intruments at the same time). The music and feelings provoked by it can be discussed, and then the music can be
adjusted to fit any mood.
